# Welcome to our final project done with Ironhack!

## Our project

We decided to make a website where people can look for potential new fluffy friends to take home.

## Why?

In France alone, tens of thousands of pets are abandoned every year, especially in the summer months when people leave on vacation. We'd like to encourage people to adopt pets that need homes. Adopt, don't shop. :)

## What?

With our app, you can see a list of pets available, find out more details about them, and if you sign up and login, you can edit the page or delete it. There are two different kinds of accounts - adopters, and associations. In a future version, adopters will be able to contact associations about the pets they have available for adoption.

# Dev Details

This portion of the webapp was made with Express, MongoDB, and Node.

# Run on your computer
